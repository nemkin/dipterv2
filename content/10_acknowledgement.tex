Firstly, I would like to thank my advisor, dr.~Katalin Friedl, for her commitment to spending a significant amount of time with me, discussing my research throughout my master's degree program. Without her supervision and mathematical expertise, this effort would not have been achievable.

Secondly, I would like to thank the Quantum Information National Laboratory for their continued support of quantum informatics research in our university.
