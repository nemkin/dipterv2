Firstly, I would like to thank my advisor, dr.~Katalin Friedl, for her commitment to spending a significant amount of time with me, discussing my research both during the school year and over the summer. Without her supervision and mathematical expertise, this effort would not have been achievable.

Secondly, I would like to thank the Quantum Information National Laboratory for providing me with a quantum research scholarship, which motivated me to work strenuously over the past months and submit this report to the Scientific Students' Associations Conference this year.
